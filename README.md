# NexusPortal

Customer Portal — self-service catalogue, quick ordering, orders, invoices, payments and support for wholesale buyers.

Part of the **Nexus suite** — five interconnected but independent workspaces, each a self-contained static web app (no build step, no framework, no runtime dependencies):

- [NexusDistro](https://abraar05.github.io/NexusDistro/) — Wholesale ERP
- [NexusPeople](https://abraar05.github.io/NexusPeople/) — People & Admin
- [NexusLogistics](https://abraar05.github.io/NexusLogistics/) — Logistics Control Tower
- [NexusPortal](https://abraar05.github.io/NexusPortal/) — Customer Portal
- [NexusCRM](https://abraar05.github.io/NexusCRM/) — CRM

Each app links to the others via the **Nexus suite** section in its sidebar, but they are separate products, separately deployed, separately versioned.
